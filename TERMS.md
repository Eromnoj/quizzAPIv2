# Terms of Use - Quiz API v2

These terms govern access to the hosted Quiz API v2 service and its database. By using the API you accept them.

## Allowed non-commercial use

- You may call the API and store its responses to build personal, educational, community, or charitable projects, including live streams, demos, and hackathons, as long as you do not charge for access or derive direct revenue.
- You may self-host the codebase under the PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0 (see LICENSE) and use it for the same non-commercial purposes.
- You may accept voluntary donations or sponsorships that are not tied to paid access to the API.

## Attribution

- Wherever you expose results from the API (application, documentation, video description, credits, etc.), include the notice: `Quiz API v2 - Jonathan Moreschi (https://quizzapi.jomoreschi.fr/)`.
- Do not remove copyright, license, or attribution notices from the source code or responses.

## Prohibited uses

- Charging for access to the API, the underlying data, or any service that relies on it (subscription, one-off purchase, advertising-supported access, or resale of quota).
- Embedding the API in a paid product or platform, or using it to fulfill paid client work.
- Offering the API, or data derived from it, as part of another commercial API, dataset, or software service.

## Data handling

- Cache data locally only for the time needed by your non-commercial application.
- Do not attempt to scrape administrative routes or bypass rate limits.
- Respect user privacy and applicable laws when processing data.

## Service changes

The maintainer may modify, restrict, or discontinue the public API at any time. The terms may change; continued use of the API after an update constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
